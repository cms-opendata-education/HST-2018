During this task, you will use real data from the CMS experiment at the LHC to learn something about how this was done and hopefully discover a particle of your own!\n","\n","<img src = \"https://home.cern/sites/home.web.cern.ch/files/image/update-for_the_public/2015/03/cms-event.jpg\">\n","\n","\n","## Particle Collisions\n","\n","The LHC is trying to understand the structure of matter by smashing beams of protons together at very close to the speed of light. The energy involved in these collisions produces a shower of particles of all kinds. The CMS and ATLAS detectors look for the particles produced in these collisions and measure their properties. The speed that they are able to do this at is incredible, the LHC produces 40 000 000 collisions every second!\n","\n","Some of the particles produced in the collisions (e.g. electrons and muons) can be directly measured by the detectors. Many of the more exotic and interesting particles (e.g. the famous Higgs boson), however, live for an incredibly short time and transform (decay) into other particles before the detectors can pick them up. So how can we tell they were there? \n","\n","## Hunting for the J/$\\Psi$\n","\n","We will hunt for evidence of one of these very short lived particles, called the J/$\\psi$. Made up of a charm and anticharm quark bound together, its existence is predicted by the standard model of particle physics, but whenever one is created, it lasts an average of only $7,2 \\cdot 10^{-21}$ s before transforming into other particles. This is far too short for it to register in the detectors at the LHC. Fortunately, however, one of the ways the J/$\\psi$ can decay is into a muon-antimuon pair and CMS can detect these muons. The only problem with this, is that the detectors will see thousands of muons from each collision and only some of them will have been produced by a J/$\\psi$. We need to deal with this problem before we can claim to have discovered experimental evidence for the existence of the J/$\\psi$.\n","\n","## Invariant Mass\n","\n","There is a trick that particle physicsts can use when analysing the data produced by the detectors. By combining the momentum and energy of a pair of detected particles in a particular way, you can calculate quantitiy known as \"Invariant Mass\". If the two particles were, indeed, produced by the decay of another particle, this number will tell you the mass of that particle (in units of $GeV/c^2$). If our collisions are producing lots of J/$\\psi$ particles then there should be lots of pairs of muons with an invariant mass corresponding to the predicted mass of the J/$\\psi$.\n","\n","\n","To understand how to put this into practice and claim the discovery of a particle, we need to analyse some experimental data!\n"]},{"metadata":{"id":"DK956lP52AYs","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Jupyter Notebooks\n","\n","The document you are looking at now is a Jupyter Notebook.
